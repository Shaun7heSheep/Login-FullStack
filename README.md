# UPDATE: Deployment to Heroku is not working as free database is no longer supported:<br/>
"Free Heroku Postgres, free Heroku Data for RedisÂ®, and free Heroku Dynos are no longer available.
If you have apps using these resources, you must upgrade to our new low-cost or other paid plans to ensure your apps continue to run and retain your data. To recover your data, contact Heroku Support as soon as possible. Eligible students can apply for platform credits through our Heroku for GitHub Students program.  Learn more"

# Login-FullStack
Login/Register feature. Both Front-end and Back-end <br/>
<br/>
For back-end, I used *NodeJs* and *PostgreSQL* <br/>
Some libraries that I used: *nodemon, express, body-parser, knex, pg* <br/>
<br/>
**Note:** Since Github can only host static webs, I couldn't deploy this project on Github. Instead, I deployed this on Heroku. <br/>
You can visit the site under Environments section (on your right), with the name "shaunlogin". <br/>
Or using this url: https://shaunlogin.herokuapp.com/ <br/>
