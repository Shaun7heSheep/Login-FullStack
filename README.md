# Login-FullStack
Login/Register feature. Both Front-end and Back-end <br/>
<br/>
For back-end, I used *NodeJs* and *PostgreSQL* <br/>
Some libraries that I used: *nodemon, express, body-parser, knex, pg* <br/>
<br/>
**Note:** Since Github can only host static webs, I couldn't deploy this project on Github. Instead, I deployed this on Heroku. <br/>
You can visit the site in Environments section, under the name "shaunlogin". <br/>
Or using this url: https://shaunlogin.herokuapp.com/ <br/>
